## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the required libraries. You can install the necessary libraries using the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/titanic-ml-project.git
   cd titanic-ml-project
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter notebooks in your preferred environment (e.g., Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook).
3. Follow the notebooks in order:
   - Start with `01_EDA.ipynb` for exploratory data analysis.
   - Proceed to `02_Preprocessing.ipynb` for data cleaning and preparation.
   - Use `03_Modeling.ipynb` to build and train your machine learning models.
   - Finally, review `04_Evaluation.ipynb` for model evaluation and conclusions.

## Data
The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. It contains information about the passengers, including features such as age, gender, class, and whether they survived.

## Modeling
This project explores various machine learning algorithms, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines

## Evaluation
Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Visualizations such as ROC curves are also included to assess model performance.
